## _Sentiment Predictor_
A multilingual sentiment predictor which classifies English, Urdu or Roman Urdu text as Negative or Positive. It uses sentiment analysis algorithms of machine learning to classify negative and positive texts. We used 5 different algorithms and then calculated the sum of predictions to finalize if a text is most likely to be negative or positive in sentiment.

## _Opinion Mining on Government_
For comparative analysis of sentiments of people on PTI, PMLN and PPP (Pakistani political parties), see the figure. We can see that number of tweets collected on each party vary. This was not done deliberately. But these stats do speak about the popularity of each party. Looking at the blue bars, we can see that people had more positive sentiments for each party. When it comes to PMLN and PPP the negative sentiments are almost half of the positive sentiments. Whereas PTI has a very small difference between sentiments. We can say that it is almost as much hated as much as it is supported.
