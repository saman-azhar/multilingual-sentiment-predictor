# multilingual-sentiment-predictor
A multilingual sentiment predictor which classifies English, Urdu or Roman Urdu text as Negative or Positive. It uses sentiment analysis algorithms of machine learning to classify negative and positive texts.

You can input a text and choose language of the text and the API will predict sentiment and show results.
